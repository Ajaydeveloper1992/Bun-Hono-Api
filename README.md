# Bun-Hono-Api
Hono - means flameðŸ”¥ in Japanese - is a small, simple, and ultrafast web framework built on Web Standards. It works on any JavaScript runtime: Cloudflare Workers, Fastly Compute, Deno, Bun, Vercel, Netlify, AWS Lambda, Lambda@Edge, and Node.js.

Bun is an all-in-one toolkit for JavaScript and TypeScript apps. It ships as a single executable called bun.

At its core is the Bun runtime, a fast JavaScript runtime designed as a drop-in replacement for Node.js. It's written in Zig and powered by JavaScriptCore under the hood, dramatically reducing startup times and memory usage.
