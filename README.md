Bun is an all-in-one toolkit for JavaScript and TypeScript apps. It ships as a single executable called bun.
Bun.serve({
  port: 3000,
  fetch: app.fetch,
})

console.log('ðŸš€ Server running on http://localhost:3000')

At its core is the Bun runtime, a fast JavaScript runtime designed as a drop-in replacement for Node.js. It's written in Zig and powered by JavaScriptCore under the hood, dramatically reducing startup times and memory usage.
This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.10. [Bun]
(https://bun.sh/docs) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

Hono
Hono - means flameðŸ”¥ in Japanese - is a small, simple, and ultrafast web framework built on Web Standards. It works on any JavaScript runtime: Cloudflare Workers, Fastly Compute, Deno, Bun, Vercel, Netlify, AWS Lambda, Lambda@Edge, and Node.js. (https://hono.dev/docs/)



Fast, but not only fast.
